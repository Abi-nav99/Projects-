HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION:
    The view of this project is to predict the price of the house according to the parameters of the house.As House price PREDICTION is a very 
    small model, so i had used shallow neural networks for the training and the dataset used is a also small. Additionally I'd compared the 
    accuracy difference between machine learning and Deep learning model.

HANDWRITING RECOGNITION:
    The focus of the project is to detect the hand written digits from 0-9. Firstly i'd used statistical models for training. Next I'd shifted
    to Neural networks and then on to Deep Convolutional Neural networks, in which I found a great rise in accuracy. The remarkable thing that
    I'd used was Callbacks, which restricts my model from overfitting because the callbacks stops the training after it reaches a specific 
    threshold. The dataset used was the famous MNIST and the accuracy is 99%.

FASHION MNIST:
    The focus of the project is to detect the fashion items say clothes, shoes, watches etc. Firstly started with the basic neural networks and
    moved on to Deep Convolutional Neural networks. By adjusting the parameters and hyper parameters I get to achieve a good accuracy. I'd used
    Callbacks. The dataset used was FASHION MNIST, accuracy 98%.

Happy or Sad:
    The main theme of this project is to detect the emotions, either happy or sad. My dataset consists of 80 images among them 40 are happy 
    and 40 are sad. I'd considered Deep Convolutional Neural networks for training the model and used callbacks to avoid overfitting. One of 
    the impressive thing I'd used was Image Augmentation because of having very limited amount of data. This technique take the images and
    perform crop, sheer, reflect x and y axis,rescale, and a lot more, and passes to the alogorithm on the go without storing in the memory. 

CAT vs DOG:
    The preview of this project is to detect cat and the dog. The dataset used is from kaggle which consists of 25000 images. I'd used Deep
    Convolutional neural networks for model training. I'd used Image Augmentation and callbacks and ended up with great accuracy.

HORSE vs HUMAN:
    The theme of this project is to detect Horse and the Human. First I'd used Deep Convolutional neural networks with image Augmentation and 
    callbacks but i didn't find it satisfactory. So I had used the famous architecture called Inception V3 with transfer learning. I froze the 
    previous layers from being retrained and trained the last 2 dense layers for achieving my desired output. I was delighted to see such 
    great accuracy. 

ROCK, PAPER, SCISSOR:
    This is a multi-class classification project in which I am used to detect the old school game rock paper scissor using the hand gestures.
    I'd used dcnn along with image Augmentation and callbacks. 

MNIST for hand gestures RECOGNITION:
    This project is about to detect the hand gestures of digits from 0-9. I'd used deep Convolutional neural networks along with image 
    Augmentation and callbacks.The dataset is taken from kaggle. 

Sarcasm Detection:
    This project is used to detect the Sarcasm from the user reviews. I'd used neural networks for training the model. Firstly I'd tokenized
    the entire dataset set and used padding to keep all the sequences length the same. Next used Word Embedding for an n-dimensional vector.
    By adjusting the parameters i get to achieve 85% accuracy.

IMDB reviews:
    This project is based on extracting the sentiment from all the reviews from users whether it is positive or negative. Firstly I'd trained
    with normal Embedding with Dense layer, I ended up with poor accuracy. Next I used word Embedding with Bidirectional LSTM with 2 layerswhich helped 
    my model to secure an accuracy around 100% on training 90% test set, but yeah it sightly led to overfitting. I either trained it with
    8k sub-words corpus rather than entire words corpus but the accuracy drove too badly because sub-words will lose the entire meaning of 
    the sentence. 

BBC archieves:
    This project is used to categorize the BBC news articles into 6 categories say sports, entertainment, etc. Firstly I'd removed commonly 
    occuring stopwords which was the noise for the data. Training labels were turned into sequences. Then I had used word Embedding to project 
    into n-dimensional vector to categorize the similar meaning words and then used softmax activation with output layer of 6 neurons for 
    categorization. The accuracy was 95%.

TWeets:
    This project is used to detect positive and negative tweets from the twitter users. The dataset used is from kaggle.

Irysh song generation:
    This project is based on to generate an Irysh poetry or song. I'd used around 1980 lines of Irysh songs dataset. First tokenized the 
    entire dataset and converted into sequences and added padding to the data. I'd used Bidirectional LSTM for training the model because
    it consists of memory cell states which are really helpful for generating the new lines. I'd used Adam optimizer with my own learning 
    rate for the best accuracy. The accuracy was 80% with 100 epochs.

Shakespeare poetry
    The theme of the project is to generate a poetry like Shakespeare's poetry using old english literature. I'd used 2 layer bi-directional
    LSTM with droupout regularization. Finally I reached an accuracy of 79.87% over 100 epochs. It accuracy will increase if we train it upon
    500 epochs. I'd used matplot library to plot the graph to visualize the loss and accuracy.

Sunspots-Forcasting:
    This project is used to predict the sunspots in the future based upon the previous data. The dataset is taken from kaggle. FIrstly I'd 
    used machine learning technique like mean squared error and mean absolute error. I'd cleaned date using trailing and centered windows 
    by taking t-365days data to reduce the noise and a lot more. Next I used LSTM, DCNN to train the model, it took a bit long time to train
    but ended up with good accuracy. I'd used learning Rate Scheduler too which is a bit advantage.

Melbourne-Climate-Temperature:
    This project is used to predict the future temperature in Melbourne.I'd used CNN along with LSTM to train the model. I'd used lambda 
    layers in Addition while creating the model architecture. 

Speech Recognition:
    This project is a Trigger Word detection like Google,Alexa,Siri. I'd developed a speech recognition system in order to activate by speech.
    The trigger word is "ACTIVATE". I'd used Convolutional layers along with Gradient Recurrent Units to design the model. The accuracy is 
    not soo good but it hit the mark.

JAZZ Music generation:
    This project to used to genenrate a new music based upon the large corpus of music data. I'd used LSTM and achieved an accuracy of 90% 
    for 100 epochs

EMOJIFY:
    This project is used to geneate emojis based on the text. I'd used pre-trained embedding layers along with LSTM with dropout regularization.
    I hit an accuracy of 89% for 50 epochs.

FACE RECOGNITION:
    This project is to recoginize the face and detect the emotions. I'd used Deep Convolutional neural networks along I've added Batch 
    NOrmalization while creating the architecture. The accuracy got a hit of 99% which is soo amazing. 

Neural Style Transfer:
    This project is used to take a style image and a content image and club them both.

Autonomous Driving Car Detection:
    This project is used to detect more than 1 car from the frame. I'd used YOLO-V3 architecture for training the model and used Edge detection
    techniques. It is used to predict all cars in real time video. The dataset used is coco dataset. I'd used non-max supression technique
    which is widely used in recogniton models, it's intersection over Union. The accuracy is good because the model was pre trained before.

Machine Translation:
    I'd used LSTM
